it means actually "AUTOCOMPLETE"
document.   -> intellisense lists all the methods and properties
hit TAB to autocomplete it
Hover over the function, vscode will show the documentation for it
Ctrl+Space -> bring up the intellisense

strongly typed (typescript, dart) -> gets better intellisense
dynamically typed (js, python) -> gets less intellisense

explicit type needed
