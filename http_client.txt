for app developers, it is crucial to make network requests via APIs

inefficent way to test an API is to write the code manually

many programmers use "http clients" to make requests on a GUI ->
most popular one is POSTMAN
but it has ton of features that not many programmers need them
it requires you to download a seperate program which kinda defeats the purpose of integrated development environment

luckily there are several different http client extensions
one of the famous is: "THUNDER CLIENT"

when installed, it will add a sign on the sidebar
you can create a request by "New Request" button
it keeps track of history of requests
